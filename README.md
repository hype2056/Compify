# Compify 🧠📘

Compify is a web platform designed to help students learn **competition mathematics** through a structured, progressive learning path.

Instead of random problem sets, Compify focuses on **clarity, intuition, and gradual difficulty increases**, making competition math more approachable and effective.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Many students struggle with competition math because:
- Problems feel disconnected  
- Solutions jump too quickly  
- There’s no clear roadmap of what to learn next  

Compify aims to solve this by guiding learners step-by-step and helping them **build real problem-solving intuition**, not just memorize tricks.
